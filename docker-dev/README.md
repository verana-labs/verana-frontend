# Setting up a development environment with docker

![2060 logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2060-io/.github/44bf28569fec0251a9367a9f6911adfa18a01a7c/profile/assets/2060_logo.svg)

In this document, you will learn how to setup a development environment for working/modifying the verifier-app backend.

## Setup a SSL port forwarding service

For being able to test your service directly from your cellphone, you will need a port forwarding service.

If you don't have available ports for SSL usage, you must replace the IP `192.168.149.127` with the IP assigned to your local network.

## Prepare docker-compose and start the containers

Before starting, replace the URLs according to the ports with the ones generated by your Public URL.  
If you don't have available ports for SSL usage, replace the IP as mentioned in the previous step.
Once this is done, proceed with the `docker-compose` setup.

# VERANA FRONT - Next.js Starter Project 

This is a starter project for React that uses Next.js.

## Running locally in development mode

We recommend using pnpm as your package manager, as it's faster and more efficient than npm or yarn. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:
    
    npm install -g pnpm

To get started, just clone the repository and run `pnpm install && pnpm dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-frontend.git
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev

## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `pnpm run build` and run it with `pnpm start`:

    pnpm install
    pnpm run build
    pnpm start
